# Topological Analysis of Emotional Eye Movement Data
This repository contains code and resources for classifying emotional states based on eye movement trajectories using persistent homology and traditional machine learning approaches. The project includes two main notebooks:
PersistentHomology.ipynb: A topological machine learning pipeline using time-delay embeddings and persistence statistics for feature extraction.
NormalML.ipynb: A baseline approach using raw processed features and traditional classification.
Note: You must configure the data directory and download the dataset separately for the code to run properly.
